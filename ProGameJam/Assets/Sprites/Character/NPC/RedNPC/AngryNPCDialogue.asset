  - "You carried both Fear and Sorrow within you, Auralis. And with them, you entered
    Embercrag\u2026 a land scorched by rage and fire."
  - "Lava roared beneath your feet. The sky bled smoke. This was no ordinary battlefield\u2014this
    was Furyblaze\u2019s domain."
  - "He emerged from the inferno\u2014a blazing monster, all fury and flame. But
    he wasn\u2019t just a beast\u2026"
  - "He was you. Or rather\u2026 what you could become. A twisted reflection. Furyblaze
    called himself the rightful ruler of Lumora."
  - He said you were weak. Broken. And that your failure had doomed the world.
