  - "You don\u2019t remember\u2026 do you?"
  - "Then let me remind you\u2026"
  - You were once Auralis, the guardian deity of Lumora
  - A radiant world filled with light and life. But from the abyss came Daros, the
    embodiment of destruction, and everything changed.
  - 'In the final battle, your soul was torn into four: Fear, Sorrow, Rage, and Hope.'
  - 'The first three became monsters. '
  - Hope vanished.
  - "Lumora fell into darkness\u2026 and you were reborn as a human, stripped of
    memory, stripped of power."
