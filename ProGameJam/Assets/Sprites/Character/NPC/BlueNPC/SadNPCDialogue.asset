  dialogueLines:
  - "The soul of Shadowrend led you here\u2026 to Mistveil. A forest drained of all
    warmth, where sorrow clings to every leaf and shadow."
  - "Here, Sorrowveil reigns\u2014a towering wraith with eyes forever weeping, his
    body a drifting veil of smoke. He holds this land in his grasp, trapping lost
    souls within the depths of a mournful lake."
  - "You walked among fading memories, glimpses of Lumora as it once was\u2014a paradise,
    radiant and whole. And I know\u2026 your heart broke, didn\u2019t it?"
